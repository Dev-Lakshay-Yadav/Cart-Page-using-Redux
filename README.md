This project is a simple cart page built using React and Redux Toolkit. The goal of this project is to practice and learn state management using Redux Toolkit by implementing basic cart functionalities such as adding, removing, and updating items in the cart. The key features include adding items to the cart, removing items, updating item quantities, displaying total price and item count, and maintaining persistent state using Redux Toolkit.

The tech stack includes React, Redux Toolkit, React-Redux, and optional Tailwind CSS for styling. To install and run the project, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, install dependencies using npm install, and start the development server with npm start.

The project structure consists of a src directory containing components like Cart.js and CartItem.js, and a redux directory containing store.js and cartSlice.js. The Redux Toolkit implementation involves creating a cartSlice.js file with actions for adding, removing, and updating items. The store.js file configures the Redux store by importing the cartReducer. The index.js file provides the store to the React app using the Provider component.

Future enhancements include implementing local storage persistence, adding product filtering and sorting, and improving UI/UX with better design. This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
